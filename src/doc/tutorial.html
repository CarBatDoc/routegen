<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>
This tutorial explains how to generate route movies, using Route Generator.
</p>
<h2>New in version 1.7</h2>

<h3>1. Set begin/end delay</h3>
You can now select a delay in seconds to add before the beginning or after the end of the generated movie (this delay will
not be visible in the preview, only in the generated movie)
<h3>2. Select different generator</h3>
<p>
It's now possible to select a different generator than bmp2avi on Windows, namely ffmpeg (on Linux this is the default).
This encoder is quicker than bmp2avi and it's possible to use more different codec types (MPEG-4 is the default) and also select a different bitrate
of the generated output video.
If you want to do this, you will first have to download
<a href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/">the Zeranoe FFmpeg Windows builds</a>.
To extract any of the builds you will need to download and install <a href="http://7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>.
</p>
<p>
After that you have extracted the downloaded 7-Zip file can select <i>ffmpeg</i> in the Advanced tab of the Route Generator Preferences window.
The program will then ask you for the location of the FFmpeg encoder. You will have to browse for the FFmpeg executable (ffmpeg.exe),
which is usually located in the <i>bin</i> sub-directory of the extracted FFmpeg 7zip file:

<h3>3. New Google Maps import support</h3>
Route Generator now supports the new interface of Google Maps. For the rest nothing has changed.
See <strong>Open map</strong> below for the instructions about importing a map from Google Maps.
<h2>Open map</h2>
You can open an image file from an existing map or import a map from Google Maps (see below).

For the best results, the size of the map should be the same as the resolution of the movie
in which you want to place the final route movie
(e.g. 768 x 576 for standard DVD or 1920×1080 for full HD). Route Generator can use any format and
does not check this, so you should find out what the best format is you want to use.
The easiest way is to grab a frame of a map you filmed with your camera, save it as BMP file and use
that image as a map background. Or check the size of the screenshot and create an image yourself,
with the same size.

<h3>Import map from Google Maps</h3>
<strong>Note:</strong> Google changes it's interface regularly, so the screenshots below probably don't completely match.<br>
To import a map from Google Maps, go to File->Import from Google Maps or click <img src="google-maps-logo.png">.
First set the correct resolution that you want to use for your output map.

<p>
Now browse to Google Maps in your browser and locate a map that you want to use. Then copy the link to the
URL field in Route Generator by:

<p>
Selecting the properties menu and select <strong>Share or embed map</strong>:<br>
<img src="google-link.png"><br><br>
Copy the link by selecting it and press Ctrl+c<br>
<img src="google-link-copy.png"><br><br>
Right click the URL field in Route Generator and select Paste:<br>
<img src="google-link-paste.png"><br><br>
</p>

Now click "Go" to start loading the map. You can still drag the map a littlebit until you are satisfied. Then click OK to save the map and use it
in Route Generator.

<h2>Draw route</h2>
Activate <i>Draw mode</i> (from menu: Tools->Draw mode, or click <img src="drawmode.png">).
Now start drawing a route, by clicking and dragging your mouse over the map. 
You can reset the route by deactivating draw mode and activating it again. 
If you're satisfied with the route you can do some adjustments to the way the route is displayed (next section). 

<p>
<h2>Adjust route settings</h2>
<ul>
<li> Modify the width of the route by adjusting the <i>Route width</i> settings.
<li> Modify the line style of the route by adjusting the <i>Route style</i> settings.
<li> Modify the color of the route by adjusting the <i>Route color</i> settings.
<li> <i>Select vehicle icon</i> that will be shown when the route is drawn.
<li> Optionally adapt the vehicle settings from the dialog (size, angle, mirror, orientation).
<li> Optionally it's possible to let the Route Generator <i>Generate iconless begin/end frames</i>, 
     if you want to begin/end your movie without displaying the vehicle icon.
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Adding custom vehicle icons</h4>
<p>
You can add custom icons for vehicles by adding your own icon files.
The following icon formats should be accepted: *.gif, *.png, *.jpg</p>
<p>It's recommended to add icons with a transparent background (i.e. *.gif or *.png with an alpha layer). 
Also choose a reasonable size for the vehicle icons, e.g. 50x50 pixels.</p>
<b>Animated vehicle icons</b>
<p>When the vehicle is an animated image (e.g. animated gif), Route Generator will playback the animation
in the generated movie!
</p>

<p>
<h2>Show preview</h2>
To get a preview of the movie that will be generated click the <i>Playback</i> button <img src="player_play.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Playback).<br>
You can stop the preview by clicking <i>Stop</i> <img src="player_stop.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Stop)
</p>
<p>
<h2>Generate route</h2>
Finally generate the route movie into a directory by clicking the <i>Generate route</i> button <img src="generate.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Generate route). 
For each frame of the movie, Route Generator will generate a *.bmp file in the selected directory. 
Next, these frames (*.bmp files) will be converted to an AVI movie, using bmp2avi, which is 
by default included with Route Generator.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE: Each BMP-file will be written in uncompressed format! E.g. one BMP-file of 768x576 uses about 1.2 MB of
diskspace. Route Generator assumes 25fps, so for each second 25 x 1.2MB = 30MB of disk space is required for
the BMP-files only and another 30MB for the generated AVI movie!
</b> (Route Generator will also give a rough estimation 
of the required diskspace, before you start generating the route)
</p>
<p>
If somehow bmp2avi is not available, you can download it from:
<u>http://www.divx-digest.com/software/bmp2avi.html</u> 
<br>
<u>Make sure to download the commandline version (<i>bmp2avi.exe</i>)!</u>
You can extract <i>bmp2avi.exe</i> into any directory.
When Route Generator starts up, it will automatically ask you to locate the file <i>bmp2avi.exe</i>.
</p>
<p>
After the movie is generated, you can import it in you video editing software. You can optionally 
finetune the movie by adding extra begin/end frames that you pick from the directory containing 
the generated *.BMP files.<br>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Modifying BMP2AVI/FFmpeg preferences</h2>
<p>
It's possible to modify the settings that Bmp2Avi or FFmpeg uses to
convert BMP's to an AVI file. To change these settings open the preferences through Edit->Preferences.
Here you can change 6 Bmp2Avi settings:
</p>
<h3>Bmp2Avi location</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the location of bmp2avi.exe, in case you have it in a different location
or for some reason Route Generator is unable to find it anymore.
</p>
<h3>Name of output AVI</h3>
By default the name of the generated AVI is "out.avi", but here you can change this name. E.g.
when you change this to "mymovie", the generated movie will be called "mymovie.avi".
<p>
</p>
<h3>Delete BMP's</h3>
<p>
When you check this, the BMP's will automatically be deleted after the bmp2avi conversion. The
first and last frame will not be deleted, so you can still use them in your video editing software.
</p>
<h3>FPS</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the frame rate of the generated AVI (the default is 25).
</p>
<h3>Bitrate (FFmpeg generator only)</h3>
<p>
Here  you can change the bitrate (in kb/s) of the generated movie.
</p>
<h3>Key frame rate</h3>
<p>
This value indicates after how many frames a key frame is created (the default is 25).
</p>
<h3>Codec</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the codec that Bmp2Avi uses to generate the movie. This can result
in smaller movies, but it's possible that not all codecs are accepted by your video editing software.
(the default is "Uncompressed")
