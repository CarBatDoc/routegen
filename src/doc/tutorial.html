<h1>Tutorial</h1>
This tutorial explains how to generate route movies, using Route Generator.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Open map</h2>
You can open an image file from an existing map or import a map from Google Maps (see below).

For the best results, the size of the map should be the same as the resolution of the movie
in which you want to place the final route movie
(e.g. 768 x 576 for standard DVD or 1920×1080 for full HD). Route Generator can use any format and
does not check this, so you should find out what the best format is you want to use.
The easiest way is to grab a frame of a map you filmed with your camera, save it as BMP file and use
that image as a map background. Or check the size of the screenshot and create an image yourself,
with the same size.

<h3>Import map from Google Maps</h3>
To import a map from Google Maps, go to File->Import from Google Maps or click <img src="google-maps-logo.png">.
First set the correct resolution that you want to use for your output map.

<p>
Now browse to Google Maps in your browser and locate a map that you want to use. Then copy the link to the
URL field in Route Generator as follows:

<p>
Click Link to open the URL frame in your browser:<br>
<img src="google-link.png"><br><br>
Right click the URL and select Copy:<br>
<img src="google-link-copy.png"><br><br>
Right click the URL field in Route Generator and select Paste:<br>
<img src="google-link-paste.png"><br><br>
</p>

Now click "Go" to start loading the map. When you are satisfied, click OK to save the map and use it
in Route Generator.

<h2>Draw route</h2>
Activate <i>Draw mode</i> (from menu: Tools->Draw mode, or click <img src="drawmode.png">).
Now start drawing a route, by clicking and dragging your mouse over the map. 
You can reset the route by deactivating draw mode and activating it again. 
If you're satisfied with the route you can do some adjustments to the way the route is displayed (next section). 

<h3>Interpolation mode</h3>
A new feature since version 1.3 is automatic route interpolation. When you check the <i>Interpolation</i> checkbox
before you start drawing a new route, you only have to click on a few points on the map. When you're ready, de-activate
<i>Draw mode by clicking </i><img src="drawmode.png">. After that the route will automatically be "interpolated" between
the clicked points. You can adapt the lenght of the route by modifying the number besides the <i>Interpolation</i> checkbox.
This number indicates the number of seconds that the complete route will take.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Adjust route settings</h2>
<ul>
<li> Modify the width of the route by adjusting the <i>Route width</i> settings.
<li> Modify the line style of the route by adjusting the <i>Route style</i> settings. <b>(new since version 1.3!)</b>
<li> Modify the color of the route by adjusting the <i>Route color</i> settings.
<li> <i>Select vehicle icon</i> that will be shown when the route is drawn.
<li> Correct the direction of the vehicle by checking the <i>Mirror icon</i> checbox and modifying the
     angle. (Explained below this section.)
<li> Optionally it's possible to let the Route Generator <i>Generate iconless begin/end frames</i>, 
     if you want to begin/end your movie without displaying the vehicle icon.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The vehicle icon</h3>
<p> Route Generator tries to adapt the direction of the vehicle to
the direction of the route. It assumes that the vehicle's base direction is from left to right
(or west to east). This is indicated with a red arrow through the preview icon of the selected
vehicle on the toolbar: <br>
<img src="toolbar.png"><br>
<p>
In the situation displayed above, the vehicle is already displayed correctly left to right, so you don't need
to correct it's angle. But for some vehicles you need to correct the angle or even mirror the icon, because it
doesn't match the red arrow:
<br>
<img src="bike.png"><br>
In this case, just modify the angle, until the vehicle direction mathces the red arrow:<br>
<img src="bike_corrected.png">
</p>
</p>
<h4>Adding custom vehicle icons</h4>
<p>
You can add custom icons for vehicles by adding your own icon files into the <i>vehicles</i> 
subfolder of the Route Generator installation folder. The following icon formats should be accepted: 
*.bmp, *.gif, *.png, *.bmp, *.jpg, *.tif</p>
<p>It's recommended to add icons with a transparent background (i.e. *.gif or *.png with an alpha layer). 
Also choose a reasonable size for the vehicle icons, e.g. 50x50 pixels.</p>
<p>
Route Generator needs to be restarted when you add new vehicle icons, otherwise it won't detect them.
</p>
<b>Animated vehicle icons</b>
<p>When the vehicle is an animated image (e.g. animated gif), Route Generator will playback the animation
in the generated movie!
</p>

</p>

<p>
<h2>Show preview</h2>
To get a preview of the movie that will be generated click the <i>Playback</i> button <img src="player_play.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Playback).<br>
You can stop the preview by clicking <i>Stop</i> <img src="player_stop.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Stop)
</p>
<p>
<h2>Generate route</h2>
Finally generate the route movie into a directory by clicking the <i>Generate route</i> button <img src="generate.png">
(or from menu: Tools->Generate route). 
For each frame of the movie, Route Generator will generate a *.bmp file in the selected directory. 
Next, these frames (*.bmp files) will be converted to an AVI movie, using bmp2avi, which is 
by default included with Route Generator.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE: Each BMP-file will be written in uncompressed format! E.g. one BMP-file of 768x576 uses about 1.2 MB of
diskspace. Route Generator assumes 25fps, so for each second 25 x 1.2MB = 30MB of disk space is required for
the BMP-files only and another 30MB for the generated AVI movie!
</b> (Route Generator will also give a rough estimation 
of the required diskspace, before you start generating the route)
</p>
<p>
If somehow bmp2avi is not available, you can download it from:
<u>http://www.divx-digest.com/software/bmp2avi.html</u> 
<br>
<u>Make sure to download the commandline version (<i>bmp2avi.exe</i>)!</u>
You can extract <i>bmp2avi.exe</i> into any directory.
When Route Generator starts up, it will automatically ask you to locate the file <i>bmp2avi.exe</i>.
</p>
<p>
After the movie is generated, you can import it in you video editing software. You can optionally 
finetune the movie by adding extra begin/end frames that you pick from the directory containing 
the generated *.BMP files.<br>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Modifying BMP2AVI preferences</h2>
<p>
Since version 1.3 of Route Generator, it's possible to modify the settings that Bmp2Avi uses to
convert BMP's to an AVI file. To change these settings open the preferences through Edit->Preferences.
Here you can change 6 Bmp2Avi settings:
</p>
<h3>Bmp2Avi location</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the location of bmp2avi.exe, in case you have it in a different location
or for some reason Route Generator is unable to find it anymore.
</p>
<h3>Name of output AVI</h3>
By default the name of the generated AVI is "out.avi", but here you can change this name. E.g.
when you change this to "mymovie", the generated movie will be called "mymovie.avi".
<p>
</p>
<h3>Delete BMP's</h3>
<p>
When you check this, the BMP's will automatically be deleted after the bmp2avi conversion. The
first and last frame will not be deleted, so you can still use them in your video editing software.
</p>
<h3>FPS</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the frame rate of the generated AVI (the default is 25).
</p>
<h3>Key frame rate</h3>
<p>
This value indicates after how many frames a key frame is created (the default is 25).
</p>
<h3>Codec</h3>
<p>
Here you can change the codec that Bmp2Avi uses to generate the movie. This can result
in smaller movies, but it's possible that not all codecs are accepted by your video editing software.
(the default is "Uncompressed")
